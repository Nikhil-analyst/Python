#Complete the script so that it prints out the letter i using negative indexing
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

# Ans:
print(letters[-2])


# Besides the left-to-right positive indexing system that starts from zero, sequence data types such as
# lists also have a second indexing system that starts from -1 and decreases by one from right to left.
