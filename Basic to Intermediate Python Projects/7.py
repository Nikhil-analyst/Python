#Complete the script so that it prints out a list containing the first three elements of list letters
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]


#Ans:
print(letters[:3])


# [:3]  is just a shortcut [0:3] .
# Both would do the job, so you can mark this exercise as solved if the output was correct.
